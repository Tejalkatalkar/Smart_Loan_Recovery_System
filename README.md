# Smart_Loan_Recovery_System

This project involves the creation, management, and analysis of a loan dataset stored in a SQL database table named `loan_data`. The dataset captures detailed information about borrowers, loans, repayment history, and loan recovery status. 
The primary goal is to provide useful insights into loan performance, borrower behavior, and risk assessment by executing various SQL queries.
