# Smart_Loan_Recovery_System

## 📊 Project Overview
This project involves the creation, management, and analysis of a loan dataset stored in a SQL database table named `loan_data`. The dataset captures detailed information about borrowers, loans, repayment history, and loan recovery status. 
The primary goal is to provide useful insights into loan performance, borrower behavior, and risk assessment by executing various SQL queries.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Integrate with Python or BI tools for advanced visualizations  
- Automate regular reporting of risky loans  
- Extend analysis to include loan repayment trends over time  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Kaggle CSV dataset for raw data  
- Microsoft Excel for preliminary data cleaning and visualization  
- PostgreSQL for database management and SQL querying  
- Power BI for advanced data visualization and reporting  
- GitHub for version control and project sharing

## 🔄 Project Workflow

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SQL can be effectively used to analyze loan data, identify risk profiles, and support loan recovery decisions. The insights generated can assist loan officers and financial institutions in targeting high-risk borrowers and improving collection strategies.
